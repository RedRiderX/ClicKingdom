ClicKingdom
=========================
A medival empire-building clicker

## Initial Plan

You start with a ruin. You can only click it. As you start to click it a bar appears(?). After enough clicking it becomes a (small) castle.

The surrounding tiles come into focus, you can click these.
* You must click tiles in your sphere of influce to gain access to them. (Owned tiles should have a border???)
* You can gain tiles outside of your sphere of influnce but they are harder to get and easier to lose(???).
* Just clicking owned tiles gets you gold (?) (something trivial)
* Once clicked the tile brings up a menu of options:
 * Convert
   * Barracks: +1 attack. -1 gold -1 food -1 pop
   * Town: +1 gold. -1 pop
   * Farm: +1 food. -1 pop
   * Castle: +1 click power. -2 pop(?)
 * Occupy: Just get small random benefits after clicking a while on it

   
What is the hp of a tile? 
How is sphere of influnce calculated?
Where should the meter go?
What does attack power do?
  * Does it mean your soldiers are automatically weakening adjacent tiles?
  * Does it mean your soldiers attack the tiles you start attacking?

What are the player's stats?
  * gold
  * pop
  * attack power
  * click power
  * food
